    "description": "Thanks to DT Swiss for inviting us to their factory. All opinions are the presenter's own. \n\nSimon has a very special day at the DT Swiss factory, based in, you guessed it, Switzerland. He gets to understand how spokes are made and how their world famous wheels are tested & built. \n\nSubscribe to GCN: http:\/\/gcn.eu\/SubscribeToGCN\nSign up to the GCN Club: http:\/\/gcn.eu\/oH\n\nLet us know what you think of Si\u2019s guided tour of the DT Swiss factory in the comments below \n\nSimon gets to see technology that is exclusive to DT Swiss as well as handling a hot spoke, yep, a hot spoke. Some things however, remain a secret close to DT Swiss, there is a reason they\u2019ve been in existence for so long\n\nWheels are tested for both impact as well as imitation of surfaces to ensure that they are perfect for consumers.  Oh, and how about those ratchet freehubs, got to love them.\n\nStrain gauges can be attached to prototype and development wheels so that they can be assessed and refined before going into production, the gauges look very cool.\n\nSimon finally gets to check out where the wheels are built for sponsored riders\/teams, he also built a wheel himself here is the video for that http:\/\/gcn.eu\/BuildWheel \n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
