Ex pro rider Dan Lloyd asks Marco and the team about what makes the perfect team time trial and what they are doing to train for the opening stage of the Vuelta. \n\nDoes having hugely successful TT specialist Rohan Dennis benefit or hinder the team event? \n\nAlongside the physical preparation, we take a look at the Time Trial machines themselves, which are worked on by a dedicated mechanic, Jurgen Landrie (who was actually a former teammate of Dan's)!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link ",
