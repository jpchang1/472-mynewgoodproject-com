All views expressed in this video are the presenter's own.\n\nWe've seen fi'zi:k's new road shoes, and even their off road models over with our friends at GMBN. Now it's time for their 2018 saddle range, which Simon Richardson is here to unveil for the first time. \n\nSubscribe to GCN: http:\/\/gcn.eu\/SubscribeToGCN\n\nThe Spine Concept System devised by fi'zi:k is a quick and easy way for any rider to find out which of these saddles will be most suitable specifically for you.\n\nThe flexibility in your hamstrings and lower back will determine the angle of your pelvis when you are in the saddle. This pelvis angle will impact on the saddle suitability, so the different ranges are designed to take this into account. \n\nFancy your chances to become one of our 5 lucky winners?
