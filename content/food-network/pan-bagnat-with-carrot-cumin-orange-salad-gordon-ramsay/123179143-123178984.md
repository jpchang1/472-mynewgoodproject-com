    "description": "A dish to think about now that the sun is starting to shine again. Mixing a traditional French sandwich with some typically Italian fillings is a real twist. This is a meal that not many will have tried before - have a go yourself and make it your own. It's a beautiful combination of ingredients with a Ramsay-twist to excite the palette.\n\nSubscribe for weekly cooking videos. \n\nIf you liked this clip check out the rest of Gordon's channels:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/gordonramsay\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/kitchennightmares\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/thefword",
