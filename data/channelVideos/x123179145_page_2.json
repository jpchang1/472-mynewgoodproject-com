You are also engaging your body weight, arms, back, shoulders, chest and core to assist you. You would normally use the sprint to either attack from a group or the rush for the finish line.\n\n- Climbing: Riding out of the saddle when climbing allows you to produce more force as you can engage more muscle groups, as well as using your body weight to help put extra weight on the pedals. This will mean more energy consumption though. So it's recommended to sit down on the shallower gradients. \n\n- Stretching: Sometimes you will find it necessary to relieve muscle groups you are using for a prolonged period of time. There is no set time to do this, you can do it whenever, but, your body will tell you when it is aching. If the roads you ride on are undulating, it may not be necessary as you will be in and out of the saddle plenty!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/oe\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nHow & When To Change Gear On A Road Bike | GCN's Pro Tips \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/GearChange\nHow To Improve Your Balance On A Bike | GCN's Pro Tips \ud83d\udcf9 http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ob\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.

Watch out for Avi in the final kilometres! \nEdvald Boasson Hagen & Alexander Kristoff - On home soil, this pair are going to be given a deafening cheer from the locals the whole way around the circuit. Edvald has shown he is in great form right now\nMichael Matthews - Two stage wins at this year's Tour de France and the green jersey winner... Let's see how the Australian team support him on the roads of Bergen. He wont't want to take on Sagan in a sprint\n\nAmalie Dideriksen - Last year's surprise winner and she will want to prove it wasn't a fluke\nAnna Van Der Breggen - The favourite taking the start for GCN has to be the reigning Olympic champion and showed incredible form this season\nAnnemiek Van Vleuten - Recently crowned World Time Trial Champion, can she continue her obvious top form into the road race and take the rainbow jersey? Let's wait and see\nLizzie Deignan - A former world champion and hasn't had great preparation for the worlds, having recently had an operation to remove her appendix\nChloe Hosking - Controversially left out of the Australian team, she appealed against the decision and was then selected. The determination from her to win will be huge!\n\nOutside chances that Dan thinks you should keep an eye on are Michael Albasini & Lotta Lepist\u00f6.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ox\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nDoes Cycling Make You Healthy? | The GCN Show Ep. 245 \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/oy\nPeter Sagan's Specialized S-Works Tarmac | Tour de France 2017 \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/SaganTarmac\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.

Let us know in the comments \ud83d\udc47 \n\nEx-Professional cyclist Simon Richardson takes a look at what was the start of clothing brand ASSOS, a bike. Yep, that's right, they started with a bike!\n\nCarbon fibre was already on the scene in motorsports and skiing, with that in mind, Toni Maier the founder of ASSOS decided to give it a go in the bike industry. 1976 was the year, and the rest is well, history!\n\nWhy carbon? It could be manipulated into various shapes, which was very appealing to Toni Maier and ASSOS.\n\nThe lugs have an internal socket where the tubes meet one another and are bonded together.\n\nThe tube profiles have a teardrop shape and performed significantly better than any of its competitors back in 1976.\n\nThe rims were also produced by ASSOS, 16mm wide and designed with aerodyamics in mind to match the ultra narrow tubulars. (which look to be Barum from memory, Jon)\n\nThe handlebars were placed on the fork crown to get the rider as low as possible, ideal for pursuit\/kilometre events on the track. Remember, this is before TT bars were conceived. \n\nFrom this point forward the ASSOS clothing brand was born, and aerodynamic clothing too. Lycra was born, and even pro cyclists were buying ASSOS products for \"special events\".\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/oB\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nRohan Dennis' BMC Timemachine 01 | Vuelta A Espa\u00f1a 2017 \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/or\nHow To Get More Aero On Your Road Bike \u2013 With Zipp \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/2g1KErl\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.

More responsive than a traditional cyclocross bike, but unlike a road bike, the Titici has space for up to 44mm tyres. Unlike many other gravel bikes however, the Titici does away with any mudguard bosses or rack mounts.\n\nThe most distinctive feature on this bike is of course the top tube, the dramatic flattened shape towards the seat tube is what Titici call their Plate Absorbing Technology, or PAT. Designed to absorb more vibrations through increased vertical compliance, a study at the University of Parma claimed that a frame with PAT absorbs 18% more vibrations than a standard frame.\n\nTitici custom make all of their bikes in their Italian factory. First Titici make the tubes, and cut them to the required lengths for a customer\u2019s measurements. The tubes are then wrapped in \u2018pre-preg\u2019 carbon fibre strips using Titici\u2019s Progressive Bandage Workmanship. Although this is admittedly not the lightest method of producing frames, this medium gravel frame still only tips the scales at around a kilo!\n\nTitici\u2019s range is all about customisation, designed to give the buyer the exact bike they want. You can either head to a Titici dealer to get measured up for your new bike, or, if you already know your measurements you can input them on Titici\u2019s website. While there you can choose the colourway and specific components you want on your bike as well! \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/o-\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nGravel Bike vs Road Bike http:\/\/gcn.eu\/GravelvsRoad \ud83d\udcf9 \nRoad Bike vs Cyclocross Bike http:\/\/gcn.eu\/roadvscross \ud83d\udcf9 \n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nMusic: Lost And Blind (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City\nStill Ballin' - Da Tooby\nThe Beach - Sebastian Forslund\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
