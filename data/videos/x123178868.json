More responsive than a traditional cyclocross bike, but unlike a road bike, the Titici has space for up to 44mm tyres. Unlike many other gravel bikes however, the Titici does away with any mudguard bosses or rack mounts.\n\nThe most distinctive feature on this bike is of course the top tube, the dramatic flattened shape towards the seat tube is what Titici call their Plate Absorbing Technology, or PAT. Designed to absorb more vibrations through increased vertical compliance, a study at the University of Parma claimed that a frame with PAT absorbs 18% more vibrations than a standard frame.\n\nTitici custom make all of their bikes in their Italian factory. First Titici make the tubes, and cut them to the required lengths for a customer\u2019s measurements. The tubes are then wrapped in \u2018pre-preg\u2019 carbon fibre strips using Titici\u2019s Progressive Bandage Workmanship. Although this is admittedly not the lightest method of producing frames, this medium gravel frame still only tips the scales at around a kilo!\n\nTitici\u2019s range is all about customisation, designed to give the buyer the exact bike they want. You can either head to a Titici dealer to get measured up for your new bike, or, if you already know your measurements you can input them on Titici\u2019s website. While there you can choose the colourway and specific components you want on your bike as well! \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/o-\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nGravel Bike vs Road Bike http:\/\/gcn.eu\/GravelvsRoad \ud83d\udcf9 \nRoad Bike vs Cyclocross Bike http:\/\/gcn.eu\/roadvscross \ud83d\udcf9 \n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nMusic: Lost And Blind (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City\nStill Ballin' - Da Tooby\nThe Beach - Sebastian Forslund\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
