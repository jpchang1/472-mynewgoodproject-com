Let us know in the comments below \ud83d\udc47\n\nHere are some of Dan's favourite bits of tech that he was lucky enough to get to grips with at the annual pilgrimage to Eurobike.\n\nEyewear giant Oakley released 3 helmet with BOA dial\/wiring for the retention system which is very lightweight and less bulky than some systems found on other helmets.\n\nPark Tools are well renowned as being one of the finest purveyors of tools in the industry, but they don't just stop there, they are also including a beer tray and a chainkeeper, as well as a cork-screw! It's thirsty work fixing and riding bikes after all.\n\nControlTech - They showed us a fully internal cabled Cougar PCS cockpit, very neat. The video shows this in fine detail.\n\nCeramicSpeed released their UFO Drip \"chain coating\" the statistics that we were shown from their tests were very good, interestingly, a noisier chain can be faster than a silent one! \n\nFSA WE Electro\/Hydro Groupset - Plenty of nice features, including the reach adjust on the levers as well as very rounded off disc rotors so there are no sharp edges\n\nPearl Izumi showed off their P.R.O Leader v4 shoes, these feature a seamless upper to minimize pressure points, as well as a super low stack height to give a powerful pedal stroke. Most strikingly was the electroplated sole though, \u2b50\ufe0f very bling\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nLike a chainkeeper? Then check out this one from Feedback Sports\n\nRondo bikes showed off a range of gravel bikes with twin fork tips. Why? So that you can transform a bike from endurance to racing geometry, and vice-versa.\n\nCampagnolo have released SIX new groupsets. There are tge hydraulic disc brake groupsets that have landed and certainly look nice and sleek. To accompany the disc brake groupsets they've released new wheels, including the Bora One DB wheels\nCentaur replaces the Veloce groupset as the entry level groupset.\n\nLook have increased the surface area on their K\u00e9o Blade Carbon pedals and reduced the weight! That's pretty cool isn't it?\n\nThe KTM Revelator was a concept bike at the 2016 Eurobike Show and is now a consumer product, with its hidden cables and lower seat stays, it is a nice looking bike in the familiar KTM colours.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/mT\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nEurobike 2017: The Future Of Indoor Training?
