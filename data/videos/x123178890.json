Let us know how you are finding it in the comments below \ud83d\udc47\n\nEx-professional cyclists Simon Richardson and Matt Stephens are here with all you need to know about starting up with Zwift.\n\nYou will need an account, head over to http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ZwiftBeginner and sign-up, you can start with a free trial.\n\nYou will need an indoor trainer, and something that tells Zwift how fast you are riding.\nFor a basic setup this can be a speed sensor that communicates with Zwift.\nA more advanced setup is using a powermeter which transmits all metrics to the software.\nThe most accurate setup though, is to use a smart trainer. This will also increase\/decrease pedalling resistance dependant on terrain and if you are slipstreaming for instance.\n\nYou will also need a towel, drink, and we advise using a fan to help keep you cool.\nSomething also worth considering is the Zwift app, this is used as a remote control for the features available.\n\nThere are three different worlds that you can ride in, these are:\nWatopia - South Pacific Paradise, 8 routes and 42km of roads\nRichmond - 4 routes and 18.9km of roads\nLondon - 8 routes  and 27.5km of roads\n\nZwift has a calendar to show when the different courses\/routes are available to ride on as well as group rides and races that are being hosted if you wish to join in the fun.\n\nChoosing a route is simple and then you can go for a ride, you can even choose to turn onto a different route as well as doing a U-Turn and riding the other way if you see someone you would like to ride with for example.\n\nThe screen setup shows all the metrics you need, including gradient and where you are on a route\/ride. You can also see where you in comparison to others riding, as well as the watts per kg that they are outputting!\n\nYou can even customise your clothing and bike appearance onscreen, including an unlockable GCN kit! Not forgetting being able to wave at others, flick the elbow and even give other users a 'Ride-on'\n\nThere are plenty of training sessions and workouts on Zwift, including 32 GCN workouts and you can even create your own.\n\nAfter any activity the ride data is displayed and can be saved\/uploaded to your profile on sites such as Strava, Training Peaks etc.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d http:\/\/gcn.eu\/nr\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nWhat Is Zwift Workout Mode?  \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/zwift-workouts\nGCN Vs.
