Dan didn't have to look too far, then, to find some seriously cool new stuff, including... 9 new pairs of ZIpp wheels, new hubs from Rotor which have a clutch mechanism rather than a freehub, new helmets from KASK and new glasses from KOO. That's left us a bit breathless but there is yet more bike tech with a bike box from Topeak and, of course the new fi'zi:k range that we launched on the channel yesterday.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/mx\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nMore on the new fi'zi:k shoes \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/my\nMore on the new fi'zi:k saddles \ud83d\udcf9 http:\/\/gcn.eu\/mz\nThe latest GCN Show \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/mA\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
