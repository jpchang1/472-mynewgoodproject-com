If you can\u2019t, then momentarily straighten the bike up while you cross them.\n\nBraking: Braking quite simply takes longer in the wet. Make sure you always start braking a little earlier than you would in the dry. This is even more important as braking while turning in the wet is a sure fire way to get acquainted with the tarmac!\n\nGive yourself more room: If you\u2019re riding in a group in the wet, just back off the rider in front a little bit.
