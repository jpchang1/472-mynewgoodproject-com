No, seriously - it's a really, really big box.\n\nThe new generation Wattbike is here. Introducing the Atom, a smart static bike designed for cyclists. That's right, you can now use the Wattbike with your favourite smart training software like Zwift, and so much more. \n\nSimply connect to the Wattbike Hub App to use your phone or tablet as the head unit. Simon talks us through the many advanced functions on the Atom that sets it in a new class from the original Wattbike from 2008.\n\nThe dynamic magnetic resistance system is arguably the most exciting development with the new Atom, which will change the resistance through the pedals automatically when you are using compatible software. \n\nEnter the competition for your chance to win a Wattbike Atom here! \ud83c\udf81\nhttp:\/\/gcn.eu\/WinWattbikeAtom \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d http:\/\/gcn.eu\/nE\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nTest your fitness level indoors \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/GCNtestyourfitness\nWattbike indoor 60 minute endurance session  \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/1O9NaJx\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
