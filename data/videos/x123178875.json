Here are our 10 riders to watch out for.\n\n\nSubscribe to GCN: http:\/\/gcn.eu\/SubscribeToGCN\nRegister your interest in the GCN Club: http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ov\nGet exclusive GCN gear in the GCN shop! http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ow\n\nWho do you think will win the men's and women's world road race champs? Let us know your predictions in the comments below \ud83d\udc47\n\nIt has been far from easy to narrow down the selection, but here are our man Dan Lloyd's tips of who to look out for in Bergen.\n\nPeter Sagan - Two time World Champion, can he get the hat-trick of three back to back wins?!\nMichal Kwiatkowski - Showing great form and this course plays into his hands perfectly\nGreg Van Avermaet - A rider who has really come into his own in the last couple of years. Watch out for Avi in the final kilometres! \nEdvald Boasson Hagen & Alexander Kristoff - On home soil, this pair are going to be given a deafening cheer from the locals the whole way around the circuit. Edvald has shown he is in great form right now\nMichael Matthews - Two stage wins at this year's Tour de France and the green jersey winner... Let's see how the Australian team support him on the roads of Bergen. He wont't want to take on Sagan in a sprint\n\nAmalie Dideriksen - Last year's surprise winner and she will want to prove it wasn't a fluke\nAnna Van Der Breggen - The favourite taking the start for GCN has to be the reigning Olympic champion and showed incredible form this season\nAnnemiek Van Vleuten - Recently crowned World Time Trial Champion, can she continue her obvious top form into the road race and take the rainbow jersey? Let's wait and see\nLizzie Deignan - A former world champion and hasn't had great preparation for the worlds, having recently had an operation to remove her appendix\nChloe Hosking - Controversially left out of the Australian team, she appealed against the decision and was then selected. The determination from her to win will be huge!\n\nOutside chances that Dan thinks you should keep an eye on are Michael Albasini & Lotta Lepist\u00f6.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ox\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nDoes Cycling Make You Healthy? | The GCN Show Ep. 245 \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/oy\nPeter Sagan's Specialized S-Works Tarmac | Tour de France 2017 \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/SaganTarmac\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
