Let us know in the comments \ud83d\udc47\n\nWith gravel bikes being commonly used as commuter or winter bikes, Si and Matt wanted to find out how slow they are when they\u2019re ridden on the road.

The difference, as it turns out, is surprisingly small, but which is the quickest?\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/pC\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nThe difference between gravel and road bikes http:\/\/gcn.eu\/GravelvsRoad \ud83d\udcf9 \nAre E-bikes fun? http:\/\/gcn.eu\/Are-E-Bikes-Fun \ud83d\udcf9 \n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nMusic: Back In Da Days 2 - Da Tooby\n\nOnce I Was A Cat (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City\n\nRoadmasters (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City\n\nSmashing Punks 19 - Stefan Netsman\n\nSuffer City Blues (Instrumental Version) - Suffer City\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
